The code in this rtofs directory reads a binary Fortran
file and generates a data object that can be ingested into ioda.

The fortran binary file consists of records, including additional
information that needs to be skipped.
There are typically 8 bytes to be skipped between 2 data arrays.
The read data is converted from the big endian to the host
format, which is little endian in linux.
