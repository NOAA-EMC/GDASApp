The code in this rtofs directory reads a binary Fortran
file and generates a data object that can be ingested into ioda.

The fortran binary file consists of records, including additional
information that needs to be skipped.
There are typically 8 bytes to be skipped between 2 data arrays.
The read data is converted from the big endian to the host
format, which is little endian in linux.

There are currently several data objects that are read in RTOFSDataFile
and are discarded.
