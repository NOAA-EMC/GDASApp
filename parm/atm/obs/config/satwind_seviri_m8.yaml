# NOTE: Tests using the Gaussian Thinning filter (below) to duplicate GSI's thinning of SEVIRI/METEOSAT-8 satwinds
#       results in more JEDI satwinds in the diag file than in GSI, but far fewer JEDI satwinds assimilated than
#       GSI. JEDI under-counts assimilated winds by roughly 25-40%, relative to GSI, and this under-count is not
#       even including the temporal thinning which is applied in GSI but not JEDI (by this filter below). See
