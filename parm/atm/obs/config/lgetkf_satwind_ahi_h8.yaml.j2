  # NOTE: Tests using the Gaussian Thinning filter (below) to duplicate GSI's thinning of AHI/Himawari-8 satwinds
  #       results in more JEDI satwinds in the diag file than in GSI, but far fewer JEDI satwinds assimilated than
  #       GSI. JEDI under-counts assimilated winds by roughly 25-40%, relative to GSI, and this under-count is not
