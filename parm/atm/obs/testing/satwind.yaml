# configuration, see: https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow/blob/d5ae3328fa4041b177357b1133f6b92e81c859d7/scripts/exglobal_atmos_analysis.sh#L750
# This setting activates Line 1229 of setupw.f90 to scale ratio_errors by 0.8, which is applied in
# the denominator of the final ob-error, so 1/0.8 = 1.25 factor of ob-error inflation.
#
# If this nvqc functionality were to be switched off (i.e. if variational qc were to be turned off),
# you would want to remove this last inflation filter.

                         # 16 GOES AMVs (6 u-obs, 6 v-obs) that are rejected by the SatWindsErrnormCheck in UFO
                         # but are retained in GSI's equivalent experr_norm check. All 6 of these disagreements
                         # have error norm values at almost exactly 0.9, indicating a float precision/handling

                         # NOTE: This benchmark is specifically for a test with assim_freq=6, which based on
                         #       JEDI convention, cuts off data from the front-end of the time-window that is
                         #       retained in GSI. This can generate some problems with the assigned ob-errors,
                         #       particularly the UFO assigning lower ob-errors because the reduced number of
                         #       observations being assimilated will allow for fewer duplicate-ob matches than
                         #       found in GSI, which will cause GSI to downweight observations within the UFO's
                         #       truncated time-window that UFO will not downweight. This is happening on 3 of
                         #       the satwinds in this dataset. Setting the assim_freq=12, which expands the
                         #       UFO time-window wide enough to capture all of the observations that are being
                         #       assimilated in GSI from this test-data, results in these ob-error differences
                         #       disappearing.
