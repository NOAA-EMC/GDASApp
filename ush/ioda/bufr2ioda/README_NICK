1. pspl.f90 -> pspl_combined.py
   This is complete in a sense that everything looks good. Whether or not
   it runs well remains to be seen.

2. pmat2.py is two subroutines from pmat2.f90 that were used in the
   pspl.f77 code but it has been converted and looks fine.

3. sub2mem_mer.f  is in the process of being converted
   - Definitely need to replace subroutine calls from pspl

4. orders.f is from NCEPLIBS-w3emc
https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3emc/blob/develop/src/orders.f
   Somewhat converted but I don't like the new output.
   Maybe redo with codeconvertai.
   For now, it's in orders.py
